# My Setup
I have a [Draper Targa Electric Projector Screen](https://www.draperinc.com/projectionscreens/productdetail/285/targa) that was originally controlled with their [SS-1R 3 Position Rocker Switch](https://www.draperinc.com/projectionscreens/productdetailaccessories/323). The projector in use right now is a Epson Home Cinema 2350, the projector has a 5v USB port that is used as the trigger wire.
